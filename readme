I'm excited to share the successful launch of the "Library Management System" project during my internship with Softapper Tech Solutions.
My role included creating a comprehensive database schema to manage library resources such as books, borrowers, and loan transactions. 
I developed efficient SQL queries and stored procedures for book checkouts, returns, and 
overdue fines, along with features for cataloging books, searching for titles, and managing library inventory. 
This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my database management and problem-solving skills in a real-world setting.
